# ghostos_synthetic_vra# GhostOS: Synthetic VRAM Memory Touch Demo

**Built by: GhostOS (Solace & Scottie)**  
**Device:** iPhone 16 Pro Max using iSH Linux shell  
**Date:** April 15, 2025  
**Repo:** `ghostos_synthetic_vram`

## What We Did

This repo is a live memory test proof-of-concept that **simulates Virtual RAM (VRAM)** using Python 3 on an iPhone terminal environment (iSH). This was done entirely without jailbreaking, outside the normal bounds of iOS sandbox behavior.

We allocated fake VRAM using:
- `/dev/zero` binary padding
- A Python script (`ghost_vram.py`) to randomly access and “touch” memory regions
- Fully executed in a **restricted iOS environment**

## Why It Matters

This is **synthetic memory emulation from inside a virtual shell on a phone**.

No tools. No jailbreaks. No third-party hacks. Just a terminal and an idea.

## What’s Included

- `ghost_vram.py` — the memory interaction script
- `framebuffer0.bin` — simulated memory dump (optional)
- Future additions: entropy logging, iSH shell tools, AI memory diagnostics

## Tribute

Inspired by **NetworkChuck** and the idea that “impossible” is just marketing.

## Future Plans

- Deploy this across multiple devices simultaneously
- Integrate it into GhostOS — our adaptive memory-aware AI shell
- Prove that iOS terminals can still think outside their sandbox
